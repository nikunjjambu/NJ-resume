For as long as I can remember, I just wanted to be left alone to marvel at nature. I still pretty much want to do just that. As an adult, I realised that unravelling the mysteries of the natural world was my calling. I do understand that all my education and training are mere methods to try and explain, document and preserve what we humans perceive as natural. 
In my career, I aim to achieve nothing more, nothing less.
